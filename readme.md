# Combination of Common-path off-axis and Beam splitter and Retroreflective mirror based Holography
A He-Ne laser, operating at 10mW with wavelength of 632nm was used as a light source. It enters a polizer, a mirror, an analyzer and then reflected by the second mirror for proper laser alignment. A spatial filter is used to produce a clean gaussian beam. As the light was collimated, the sample was illuminated followed by the objective lens and the tube lens with 200mm focal length. From this point, an image can be imaged as a conventional microscope. A set of mirrors was used to reflect the beams that leads both the flipping holographic module can be replaced with the triangular hologram or an off-axis tau hologram. The 4f system used in this module has 75mm for each lens. For the tau hologram, a pinhole is used with the mirror to erase the information of the object so it serves as a reference beam. The other beam goes through a relay lens for the diffractive hologram (off-axis hologram) with gratings. As light enters the gratings, it splits the beam into different order. In this case, the first order enters the pinhole and the other is blocked, the second lens combine them for the interfererence.

The tau interferometer has a pinhole right after the M4 to to serve as a reference beam. The M3 beam reflects the object beam. After which, they are to be interfered with each other with the camera. In line holography was demonstrated but reconstruction was not done. For the off-axis holograhy, the pinhole used with the mirror was not successful as it did not serve as a reference beam as thought. Other papers demonstrated a method for this.

The set-up involves two microscopes with two cameras. The first beam leads to the FDIA (Flipping with Double the Imaging Area) while the other beam leads ot the common path off-axis holography

The images are taken from camer 1. Holograms from two mirrors and the retroreflective mirrors. The second image (right) is a hologram without the retroreflective mirror.

These are the images taken from Camera 1. The left image is the object beam and the image on the right is the object beam.

# *Discussion*

Simultaneous imaging and analysis can be done from the set-up. The holograms are achieved for both set-up. Intensity is an issue for both microscopes as the retroreflective mirror needs a neutral density filter to have comparable intensities to have better intereference. Regarding the Common path, it can be seen that the object beam was not erased based from the improvised pinhole. Reconstruction can be done when the reference beam is erased. Multiplexing may be done in the future when current issues are addressed. From there, phase imaging methods may be done to maximize its use.
